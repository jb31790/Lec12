## Tasks
**Exercise:** User post display!

**Objective:** Create a simple web application that fetches User posts data from a public API and displays it dynamically on the webpage.

**API:** https://dummyjson.com/posts


### Requirements:
1. HTML:
    - Create a basic HTML structure with elements to user post information (like Title, & Post.).
    - Include a button to trigger the data fetch process.

2. JavaScript:
    - Use JavaScript to fetch post data from a public API (e.g., DummyJson API).
    - Update the webpage dynamically with the fetched data.
    - Handle errors gracefully (e.g., when the API is not reachable).

3. CSS (Optional):
    - Use Bootstrap to style your page.
